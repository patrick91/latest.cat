> Why do I have a folder named ".fastapicloud" in my project? 🤔
The ".fastapicloud" folder is created when you link a directory to a FastAPI Cloud project.

> What does the "cloud.json" file contain?
The "cloud.json" file contains:
- The ID of the FastAPI app that you linked ("app_id")
- The ID of the team your FastAPI Cloud project is owned by ("team_id")

> Should I commit the ".fastapicloud" folder?
No, you should not commit the ".fastapicloud" folder to your version control system.
That's why there's a ".gitignore" file in this folder.
